This is my test project for Spring Boot Following the Book <Spring in Action> 5th
====

## 1. Commit as many as possibile

because most of my time is fragmented, so when I decide to learn something serious, I often can not stick to the end. So I decide to commit as many as possible to log the changes and knowledge i got from each chapter of the book.

## 2. make each commit runnable

I think this is the basic requirement for me, so that when i get back from the other thing, i do not have to figure out why my project has some error, and cann't startup.
